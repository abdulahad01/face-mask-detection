<h3>Facemask detection program and pre-trained weights!</h3>
<p> This is my first project on the live object detection, so please feel free to suggest changes where necessary </p>

<b>The code was made for the Colab environment so when running offline make appropriate changes.</b>
<ul>
  <li>Project inspired from : <a href= https://github.com/aieml >perceptron </a> </li>
  <li>Dataset from :<a href =https://github.com/ohyicong/masksdetection/tree/master/dataset/without_mask> Ohyicong</a></li>
  <li> For full augmented dataset visit <a href = 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hIu0WsaiZFrZaenOoQlY-i2AXJgzhPt2?usp=sharing'>my drive</a>

<i>Note : The model uses a CNN architecture so errors due to outside noise may cause variation from expected output.</i>
